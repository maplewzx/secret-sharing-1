Secret Sharing Algorithms implemented in .net
In this library, the most promising secret sharing crypto algorithms are implmeneted in C++/Cli .net
Currently, schemes: Shamir, Benaloh-Leichter Generalized Access Structure, and Schoenmakers PVSS are implemented.
Additionally, Chaum-Peterson non-interactive zero knowledge protocol was implemented.
